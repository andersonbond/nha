# Applications

Manage housing and resettlement applications.

## Description

The Applications module stores and manages application records for housing/resettlement programs. Each application can include prequalification details, applicant identity and contact information, address, and supporting documents (e.g. valid ID).

## Features

- **List applications** – View all applications in a table with key fields (e.g. prequalification no., name, origin, type, created date).
- **Add application** – Create a new application via a slide-over form (prequalification no., origin, type, name, birth date, sex, civil status, address, region/province/municipality/barangay, valid ID).
- **Edit application** – Update an existing application from the same form.
- **Delete application** – Remove an application with confirmation.
- **Quick insights** – Summary stats derived from the current application list (e.g. counts by origin or type).
