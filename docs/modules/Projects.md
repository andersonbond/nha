# Projects

Manage housing and resettlement projects.

## Description

The Projects module stores housing and resettlement projects. Each project has a code, name, program, location (region/province/municipality/barangay), financial terms (cost, downpayment, amortization, interest, selling price, terms), lot type, and approval status.

## Features

- **Filter** – Modal filter by project code, project name, region, province, lot type, and program.
- **Add project** – Create a new project via slide-over form; optional review step before submit.
- **Edit project** – Update an existing project (code is read-only).
- **Delete project** – Remove a project with confirmation.
- **Quick insights** – Stats and charts (e.g. by region, lot type, top by cost) from the current list.
