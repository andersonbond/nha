# Lot Management

Manage lots and lot awards.

## Description

Lot Management provides two sub-views: **Lots** (inventory and map) and **Lot Award** (award workflow). Lots are tied to projects and have statuses such as available, reserved, and awarded. Lot Award is used to assign lots to beneficiaries and track award status.

## Features

- **Lots**
  - Filter lots by lot number, status (available / reserved / awarded), project, and block.
  - List view of filtered lots in a compact table.
  - Satellite map preview (ESRI World Imagery; Mapbox planned for MVP 2).
  - Clear filters to reset.
- **Lot Award**
  - Placeholder form for award details: beneficiary, lot, award date, status (pending / approved / released), remarks.
  - Full award workflow and status tracking planned for MVP 2.
